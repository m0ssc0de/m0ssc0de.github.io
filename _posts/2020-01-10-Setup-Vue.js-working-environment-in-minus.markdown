Every so often, there will be some front-end work. Because they are not my major work. I may forgot the details.
So noting them could save my time.

## Install Node.js

If you are using Win and Mac, just download install package and double click it. Follow the instructions.

If you are using Linux. Follow the instruction from the [site](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation).

## Install Vue.js

In fact, we will talk about install vue cli tool.

`npm install -g @vue/cli`

## Create Vue.js project

`vue create hello-world`

This command will create a folder named `hello-world`. It contains the basic file used by vue.

`./hello-world/README.md` will tell us how to use this project with npm.

## Set dev proxy

The file `./hello-world/vue.config.js` will be used by vue to store some config.
The config below could set a dev proxy for development.

```js
module.exports = {
    devServer: {
        open: true,
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 8080,
        https: false,
        hotOnly: false,
        proxy: {
            '/api': {
                target: 'http://172.16.0.2:8800/api/',
                ws: true,
                changOrigin: true,
                pathRewrite: {
                    '^/api': ''
                }
            }
        },
        before: app => { }
    },
}
```
