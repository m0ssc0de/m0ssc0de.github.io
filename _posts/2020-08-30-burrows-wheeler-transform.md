FM-index is a method of index text. And the index could help to locate text fastly in a huge mass text.
I learn it from Wikipedia. Below is my restate. In order to be consistent with Wikipedia, the serial number of array count from `1`.

Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is the first thing to clear. It's used to compress data Originally.

Let's get in details.

Its name has the word "transform". So the raw data will be transformed into another form. Then it will could become back.

Now we have a data "ABABC$". And list all its suffix.

- 1 "ABABC$"
- 2 "BABC$"
- 3 "ABC$"
- 4 "BC$"
- 5 "C$"
- 6 "$"

The serial number represents suffix's location in origin text. We use `k` to representation this number.

Every character will have a weight. we assume "$" is smallest. "A" smaller than "B".
"B" smaller than "A". The relation of them are similar with dictionary, Lexicographic order.
By this kind order, we can have a new array.

"$" is the smallest one.

"ABABC$" and "ABC$" is smaller than others exclude "$". The third character of these two is different.
And "A" is smaller than "C". So "ABABC$" is smaller than "ABC$". And so on. There will be a suffix array.

- 1 "$"         6
- 2 "ABABC$"    1
- 3 "ABC$"      3
- 4 "BABC$"     2
- 5 "BC$"       4
- 6 "C$"        5

The first number is the serial number in suffix array. We use `i` to represent it. The second number is the serial number in the original text, the `k`.
A real suffix array in computer memory will looks like this `[6, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`.

In fact, the suffix could be a part of the rotation of origin text. "BABC$" is a part of "BABC$A". "BC$" is a part of "BC$ABA". We could complete the text for every suffix. Then there will be a new matrix.

- "$ABABC"
- "ABABC$"
- "ABC$AB"
- "BABC$A"
- "BC$ABA"
- "C$ABAB"

The last character of every suffix array item comes from the original text. The array of them is the result of the Burrows-Wheeler transform. So we get a bwt, `['C', '$', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B']`.

Now there are two array, `sa [6, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`, `bwt ['C', '$', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B']`. We could use them to get the origin text.


First create a table. Count number of characters that are small than the current characters in the `bwt`.

| `c`    | $ | A | B | C |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| `C[c]` | 0 | 1 | 3 | 5 |

There is nothing which is small than `$`. So it's 0(`C[$]=0`). There is a `$` which is small than `A`. So it's 1(`C[A]=1`).
There is 2 `A` and 1 `$`. So it's 5(`C[B]=3`).

Second, create another table. It's different with the last table. The order of the bwt will be considered.

|   | A, 1 | A, 2 | B, 3 | A, 4 | $, 5 | A, 6 |
|---|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| $ | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    | 1    |
| A | 1    | 2    | 2    | 3    | 3    | 4    |
| B | 0    | 0    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    |

In the first line, `A, 1` means the first postion of `bwt` is `A`. From the second line, the number is counting.

The first `0` means there is one `$` from start to current position(`Occ($, 1)=0`). The `4` means there is four `A` from start to current position(`Occ(A, 6)=4`).
At the third line, `1` means there is one `B` from start to current position.`Occ(B, 1)=0`, `Occ(B, 3)=1`

Let's back to the matrix again.

- 1 "$ABABC"
- 2 "ABABC$"
- 3 "ABC$AB"
- 4 "BABC$A"
- 5 "BC$ABA"
- 6 "C$ABAB"

The first character of every line comes from the original test, so do the last one.
So a character of the last characters must could be located to the first character.
With the help of `sa` and `bwt`, it will be complete.

Let's choose the first `B` in `bwt`. `bwt(3)=B`.

>`bwt ['C', '$', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B']`

With the help of first table, we could get a number. `C[B]=3`.

With the help of second table, we could get `Occ(B, 3)=1`.

`C[B] + Occ(B, 3)` is `4`. So the first `B` in `bwt` is the `B` located in the fourth line's beginning.

-    1 "$ABABC"
-    2 "ABABC$"
-    3 "ABC$AB"ðŸ‘ˆ
- ðŸ‘‰ 4 "BABC$A"
-    5 "BC$ABA"
-    6 "C$ABAB"

Use the way comes from Wikipedia:

```
LF(3) = C[L[3]] + Occ(L[3],3)
L[3] = B
LF(3) = C[B] + Occ(B, 3)
LF(3) = 3 + 1 = 4
```

Don't forgot the `sa`. With the help of it, we know the 4th item of `sa` is the 2nd item of origin text. `sa[4]=2`

> `sa [6, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`

With the counting of every item in `bwt`, we could get the whole origin text.
